}

#What does the distribution of  look like:
#1) Person Income:(APPLY LOG TRANFORMATION )
#The data is heavily right-skewed. A significant portion of person_income values is concentrated near the lower range, while a few extreme values (outliers) exist on the higher end.
#Most individuals have relatively low income, as evident from the high density at the lower end of the x-axis.


#2) lOAN INTEREST RATE:
#that the loan interest rates is unimodal with a right skew (the tail stretches more to the right).
#The right skew indicates that while most loans have interest rates around the peak, there are some loans with higher rates 
#For logistic regression do the log transformation which is not needed for the non parametric test that we want to do.

#3) LOAN_PERCENT_INCOME: -- CHECK TO SEE IF THE PERSON WITH HIGHER LOAN _PERCENT OF THEIR ICOME DEFAULT?

#The distribution is slightly right-skewed, with most values concentrated towards the lower end.
#The peak occurs around a relatively low value, indicating that many individuals are borrowing loans that take up only a small fraction of their income.
#The long tail on the right side suggests that there are individuals who allocate a significantly higher percentage of their income to loans, though they are less frequent.

#4) CREDIT SCORE:
#Since the distribution is close to normal, a transformation is likely unnecessary unless further analyses show a specific need.

#5) LOAN AMOUNT: -- NEED LOG TRANSFORMATION
#The distribution is multi-modal, indicating that there are common loan amounts that many individuals apply for, such as near $10,000 and $20,000. This could suggest specific thresholds or common amounts for loan applications.
#he distribution shows that most loans are concentrated in the lower ranges (below $20,000). The density decreases as the loan amount increases, which is typical because fewer people tend to take very high loans.

#6) cb_person_cred_hist_length
#The majority of values are concentrated on the lower end (closer to 0-10).
#The tail extends to the right, with a few larger values (above 20).


#SUMMARY 
#Apply log transformation to:
#person_income
#loan_percent_income
#loan_amnt
#cb_person_cred_hist_length

#No transformation needed for:
#loan_int_rate
#credit_score

#Based on the data, most loans are taken for education, and as a result, education loans account for a significant number of defaults. However, an interesting observation emerges: although fewer people take loans for venture capital purposes, the proportion of defaults in this category is higher than in other groups. This indicates that venture capital loans may carry a greater risk of default relative to other loan intents. Calculating the odds ratio allows us to better understand the relative likelihood of default across different loan intents, providing valuable insights into high-risk categories.

  ylab("Odds Ratio") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")

##The odds ratio chart reveals that venture loans have the highest odds of default compared to the baseline category (education loans). While education loans are the most common, they have relatively moderate default odds. Conversely, debt consolidation loans show the lowest odds of default, indicating that borrowers in this category are less likely to default than those in other groups. This insight suggests that loan intent is a significant factor influencing default risk, with venture loans requiring closer scrutiny.

#Borrowers with personal loans have the highest average credit score (637.8), indicating that individuals taking personal loans tend to have relatively better creditworthiness.
#Borrowers with medical loans have the lowest average credit score (618.8), suggesting that individuals taking medical loans might be in more financially vulnerable situations or have lower creditworthiness compared to other intents.

#Interest rates are consistent across all loan intents, with slight variations. This could imply that despite differences in credit scores, interest rates for the highest loan amounts do not vary significantly across loan intents.The minimal variation in interest rates could indicate a fixed-rate policy for high loan amounts, independent of creditworthiness.

#Loan purpose significantly impacts interest rates.
#Certain types of loans (e.g., medical, education) might be associated with higher or lower interest rates based on risk profiles.

#Previous Loan Defaults:

#This suggests that lenders adjust interest rates dynamically based on a combination of loan purpose and borrower history.

#Intrepretation:

#Income and Loan Percent Income:
#The contrasting effects of these variables suggest that while higher incomes decrease loan approval likelihood, larger loans relative to income increase approval probability. This could point to different risk assessment strategies for higher-income applicants.

#Loan Intent:
#Loans for education, venture, and personal purposes are associated with lower approval probabilities, potentially reflecting their perceived risk.

#Loan Interest Rate:
#Higher interest rates are positively associated with loan approval, possibly indicating a trade-off between risk and return for lenders.
